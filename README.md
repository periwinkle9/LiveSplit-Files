# periwinkle's LiveSplit splits/layouts

I thought it'd be cool to version-track my splits, and also I wanted to have backups
in case I ever accidentally messed up my splits, so that's why this exists now.

This repo also contains some of the layouts that I've been using for my runs, in case
anyone wants to copy them for some reason.
